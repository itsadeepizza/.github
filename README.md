# DModel Projects

Here you can find all of our deep learning projects developed during the **DModel** (Discord Meetups On DEep Learning) meetings, from October 2021 until today.

The purpose is to delve into various topics related to neural networks (GAN, reinforcement learning, graph NN, NLP, bayesian filtering, spiking NN...) by implementing models "from scratch". The main framework used is Pytorch.

All of our code is available under the MIT license.
